        <p> <h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6> [coming forward into the sitting-room.] <br/>
        Ah, good evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!</p>

<p><h6>Peter Stockmann</h6> I happened to be passing, and so—[looks into the
    dining-room]. But you have company with you, I see.</p>

<p><h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6> [a little embarrassed].
    Oh, no—it was quite by chance he came in. [Hurriedly.] Won't you come in and have something, too?</p>

<p><h6>Peter Stockmann.</p></h6> I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night! Not with my digestion.</p>

<p><h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> Oh, but just once in a way—</p>

<p><h6>Peter Stockmann.</h6> No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
    butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more economical, too.</p>

<p><h6>Mrs. Stockmann</h6> [smiling]. Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
    spendthrifts.</p>
