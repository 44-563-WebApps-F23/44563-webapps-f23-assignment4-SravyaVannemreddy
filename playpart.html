     <p class="speech">  Ah, good evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!</p>

<p><h5 class="PeterStockmann"> Peter Stockmann</h5></p> <p class="speech">I happened to be passing, and so—</p> <p class="direction"> [looks into the
    dining-room].</p> <p class="speech">But you have company with you, I see.</p>

    butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more economical, too.</p> </p>

<p><h5 class="Mrs_Stockmann">Mrs Stockmann</h5> <p class="direction">[smiling].</p> <p class="speech">Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
    spendthrifts.</p> </p>
